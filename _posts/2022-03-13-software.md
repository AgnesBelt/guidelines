# Software release

Many research teams that develop scientific software work with version control such as Git and Github. This allows versions of scientific code to be tagged and [released]() as an installable package e.g. a Python package if the code is in Python. Python packages are listed on the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/).

A software release covers all of the principles for open science and a brief decsription can be found below and longer decription can be found in the respective principle.
  
### [Workflow](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/open%20science/2022/03/18/workflow.html)
When developing a workflow for a software release it is important to develop clear objects and steps with tests so that bugs and issues can be identified and reported. This is to assure that the workflow is working as intended at the release and that bugs or issues can be fixed for next release. More advanced software development has tests inplace which are checked for each change in code to ensure consistency. One such integrated tool on Github is [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/) which builds the code and tests it with user defined tests. Travis CI has a payment plan, but for open source accounts it is free under travis-ci.com.
  
### [Version control](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/)
The software is first built using version control (such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/), Mercurial or Subversion). The version control tracks all the changes that you make and allows to also revert back to older versions. The version control system allows for collaborative work as each contributor/author can create an own "branch" and develop new code. The new code can be reviewed and compared to the other developments and "merged" to the main branch if the new developement is accepted. When the code is ready and tested it can be released.

### [License](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/practice/2022/03/01/licensing.html)
When releasing a software it is important to think about under which license you want to release it under. There are many licenses, but they can be grouped into [three groups](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5370763):

- Free-for-all licenses (permissive) This type of licenses require to acknowledge the original author(s) of the licensed work in any derivative work. However, it allows derivative works to be then published under a different type of license, and/or made proprietary.

- Keep-open licenses This type of licenses require for the derivative work to be also released under open license. However, the derivative work (e.g. a software product) could then be included as one part of a larger proprietary work.

- Share-alike (copyleft) licenses This type of licenses require that, if the licensed work is included in larger work or project, the entire work should be released open-source.

For more information on open source licenses you can find more details [on Open Source initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses).

### [Metadata](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/)
Metadata is "data about the data" meaning that it describes the context, quality and condition of a e.g. dataset.
 
### [Attribution](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/practice/2022/02/01/attribution.html)
To make sure that the right people who has contributed to the software development are properly attributed one good practice is that the authors for each script can be added on the top of the file. If documentation software such as [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) is used then, if the metadata is added on the top of the file in a certain format, it will be added to the documentation file.
If the code is collaborativley developed on Github then each author that commits to the main branch will be added as a contributor to the code. If the code is [released](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) the contributors to the Github repository will be added as contributors/authors to that release.

### [Release](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/)
A software release can be managed through for example [Github relases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository). On Github you first make a tag to mark that this version of the code is a specific version. If you also want to make a release of the code you can then create a release based on that tag.

If you make a release on GitHub then this can be linked to your Zenodo account which will give the software a DOI and also make it citable for each release you make.
  
## Example of software release - NISMOD
  
In the CCG project a Python package has been released for NISMOD [snail](https://github.com/nismod/snail/releases) under different versions using [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/).

## Useful resources
[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science includes a section on [Make](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/make.html) where additional examples of software releases in open science are described.
