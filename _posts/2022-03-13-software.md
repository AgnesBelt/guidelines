## Software release
Many of the CCG research teams work with version control, however the scientific code could also be released under a e.g. Python package if the code is in Python. One such channel is [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/) where the packages can be distributed under different versions.

A software release covers all of the principles for open science and a brief decsription can be found below and longer decription can be found in the respective principle.
  
### Workflow (Create a link to Workflow) 
When developing a workflow for a software release it is important to develop clear objects and steps with tests. This is to assure that the workflow is working as intended at the release and that potential bugs and issues can be identified and reported.
  
### Version control (create a link to version control)
The software is first built using version control (such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/)) to 

### License (Create a link to license)
When releasing a software it is important to think about under which license to release it under. 

### Metadata (create a link to metadata)
In the metadata it is important to list all contributors to the code 
 
### Attributions (create a link to attributions)


### Release (create a link to release)

  
## Example of software release - NISMOD
  
In the CCG project a Python package has been released for NISMOD [snail](https://github.com/nismod/snail/releases) under [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/) which is released under different versions.
