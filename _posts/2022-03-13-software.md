Many research teams that develop scientific software work with version control such as Git and Github. This allows versions of scientific code to be tagged and [released]() as an installable package e.g. a Python package if the code is in Python. Python packages are listed on the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/).

A software release covers all of the principles for open science and a brief decsription can be found below and longer decription can be found in the respective principle.
  
### [Workflow](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/open%20science/2022/03/18/workflow.html)
A workflow built in modular building blocks with clear objects and outputs can be of use to other users. This in turn helps Open science and reproducible research and in best case the workflow can easily be adapted to other projects and reused.
When developing a workflow for a software release it is important to develop clear objects and steps with tests so that bugs and issues can be identified and reported. This is to assure that the workflow is working as intended at the release and that bugs or issues can be fixed for next release. More advanced software development has tests inplace which are checked for each change in code to ensure consistency. One such integrated tool on Github is [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/) which builds the code and tests it with user defined tests. Travis CI has a payment plan, but for open source accounts it is free under travis-ci.com.
  
### [Version control](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/)
When developing software, the code is a living document which is under constant development. To be able to make a release a version control system is needed so that the release is tagged and bugs and issues can be related to the released version. The version control tracks all the changes that you make and allows to also revert back to older versions. The version control system also allows for collaborative work as each contributor/author can create an own "branch" and develop new code. The new code can be reviewed and compared to the other developments and "merged" to the main branch if the new developement is accepted. When the code is ready and tested it can be released.

### [License](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/practice/2022/03/01/licensing.html)
When releasing a software it is important to think about under which license you want to release it under. There are many licenses and some inforamtion can be found on  open source licenses [on Open Source initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses).

### [Metadata](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/)
Metadata is "data about the data" meaning that it describes the context, quality and condition of a e.g. dataset.
The motiavation to use meta data in software is that meta data:
- are machine readable, so the software release can be indexed (e.g. on PyPI, or Zenodo) which makes it [findable](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
- follow a standard depending on where the software is released
 
### [Attribution](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/practice/2022/02/01/attribution.html)
To make sure that the right people who has contributed to the software development are properly attributed one good practice is that the authors for each script can be added on the top of the file. If documentation software such as [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) is used then, if the metadata is added on the top of the file in a certain format, it will be added to the documentation file.
If the code is collaborativley developed on Github then each author that commits to the main branch will be added as a contributor to the code. If the code is [released](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) the contributors to the Github repository will be added as contributors/authors to that release.

### [Release](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.github.io/guidelines/)
A software release can be managed through for example [Github relases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository). On Github you first make a tag to mark that this version of the code is a specific version. If you also want to make a release of the code you can then create a release based on that tag.

If you make a release on GitHub then this can be linked to your Zenodo account which will give the software a DOI and also make it citable for each release you make.
  
## Example of software release - PyPSA
  
[The PyPSA-Eur: An Open Optimisation Model of the European Transmission System](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur) is a good example of how to release software. The workflow is written in Python and executed using snakemake. Each release is deposited on Zenodo and ascribed a DOI. In addition is each release documented in a academic short paper and archived as a pre-print in arxiv.

## Useful resources
[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science includes a section on [Make](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/make.html) where additional examples of software releases in open science are described.
