There are many good resources on how to license data.

The [u4RIA] forum provides good information on the issues relating to licensing data.

The advice can be summarised as follows:

1. Ensure that you own or have permission to publish the data
2. Select the appropriate license
3. Deposit the data in an online archive such as [Zenodo]
