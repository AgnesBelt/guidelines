# Briefings

Briefings are meant to be short and accessible knowledge outputs that condense science in key messages and are used by a specifc target audience. An example of this is a policy brief which summarises key messges relevant for policy makers. 

The target audience is one of informed professionals. In the case of a policy brief, this may include national government officials; climate negotiators; and people that work on climate policy in international organizations, the private sector, NGOs, and other stakeholders. In the case of a briefing note from a project, this may include officials and project managers from the funding institution.

In actions that lie at the interface between science and policy, and where the ground research is carried out by academia, briefings may be used to timely and quickly communicate key research outputs while the longer peer-review process for the related articles goes on. For this to be feasible, given the similarity between the briefing and the paper, it is recommended that the paper is submitted to a journal that accepts pre-rpints and the briefing is uploaded on a pre-print server (e.g. ArXiv or ResearchSquare).

## General features of briefings

### Structure and quality

* After internal review (see section below), the briefing is published by the authors on a pre-print server
* The briefing is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
* The briefing is written using a specific template agreed by all the project partners and using Overleaf
* The briefing is 1000-1300 words in total (excluding references and acknowledgements), with an additional key message box, containing 3-4 key messages (75-150 words in total).
* A referencing style is used (e.g. Nature).
* The content is structured as follows:
    1. Introduction/Context: a brief description of the wider context, the need for the research being presented, and what precisely the briefing will cover.
    2. Methodology: a description of the methodology of the research, such as what models and scenarios were used and the assumptions behind; the number and type of interviews conducted and the type of interviewee; a description of the desktop study and the process of literature review.
    3. Results: a summary of what the results of the research are.
    4. Discussion/Conclusion: What the significance of the results is.
    5. Recommendations. 2-4 recommendations (e.g., policy recommendations for a policy brief).
    6. References.
    7. Acknowledgements.

### Review workflow

1. Calls for briefs with different themes are launched periodically
2. The authors write a brief for a particular call, following all the above guidelines, and submit it with the Tag of the call and the naming convention indicated on the submission portal
3. The brief lands on the desk of the Chief Editor, who checks that:
    * The theme is in line with the one of the call
    * All the guidelines for authors are formally respected
4. The brief lands then on the desk of the Topic Editor(s), who check(s) that the topic is relevant, novel, conclusive
5. The brief is sent to at least 1 reviewer (best practice 2), who has 15 days to carry out the review
6. The authors receive the review(s) and have 15 days to deliver the revised brief
7. The reviewer(s) check the revisions and, if needed, 6 & 7 are repeated
8. The Topic Editor(s) accept the final version of the brief
9. The brief goes to proof-reading and the authors are potentially asked to make the last minor (language) edits to the manuscript in a very short time (within 48 hours)
10. The brief is published on the pre-print platform
