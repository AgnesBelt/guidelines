# Policy briefs

Policy briefs are meant to be short and accessible knowledge outputs that condense science in key messages and are used by policy makers.

## General Points

* In CCG we aim at publishing one policy brief for every scientific paper and making it available before the scientific paper is published
* Policy briefs are to be published by the authors (upon final approval) on ResearchSquare (or another pre-print server with at least equivalent features)
* Policy briefs shall be published under open access licenses (e.g. CC BY 4.0). For how to choose a license, see [licenses]
* All briefs will undergo a peer-review process before publication
* The structure and review workflow outlined below will apply

## Guidelines on structure and quality

* The brief shall be written using the template available here [template] and using Overleaf
* The brief shall be 1000-1300 words in total (excluding references and acknowledgements), with an additional key message box, containing 3-4 key messages (75-150 words in total).
* The language to be used is British English (with Oxford spelling). Authors are responsible for thorough spelling and grammar checks
* References in text are given in square brackets [1], (e.g. like in the ‘Nature’ referencing style) then provided in full in a reference list.
* The content, in general, is structured as follows: ...
    1. Introduction/Context: a brief description of the wider context, the need for the research being presented, and what precisely the policy brief will cover.
    2. Methodology: a description of the methodology of the research, such as what models and scenarios were used and the assumptions behind; the number and type of interviews conducted and the type of interviewee; a description of the desktop study and the process of literature review.
    3. Results: a summary of the what the results of the research are.
    4. Discussion/Conclusion: What the significance of the results is
    5. Recommendations. 2-4 policy recommendations. This section should be understood in isolation if at all possible. A couple of sentences briefly reiterating the context of the policy brief is needed, followed by brief recommendations which should be clearly related to and supported by the results of the study.
    6. References
    7. Acknowledgements

## Audience

The briefing should be written in language that is accessible to an audience of informed policy professionals, including national government officials; climate negotiators; and people that work on climate policy in international organizations, the private sector, NGOs, and other stakeholders.

## Review workflow

0. The review process shall be handled through (?)
1. Calls for briefs with different themes will be launched periodically within CCG
2. The authors write a brief for a particular call, following all the above guidelines, and submit it with the Tag of the call and the naming convention indicated on the submission portal
3. The brief lands on the desk of the Chief Editor, who checks that:
    * The theme is in line with the one of the call
    * All the guidelines for authors are formally respected
4. The brief lands then on the desk of the Topic Editor(s), who check(s) that the topic is relevant, novel, conclusive
5. The brief is sent to at least 1 reviewer (best practice 2), who has 15 days to carry out the review
6. The authors receive the review(s) and have 15 days to deliver the revised brief
7. The reviewer(s) check the revisions and, if needed, 6 & 7 are repeated
8. The Topic Editor(s) accept the final version of the brief
9. The brief goes to proof-reading and the authors are potentially asked to approve the last minor (language) edits to the manuscript in a very short time (within 48 hours)
10. The brief is published on the pre-print platform
