# Briefings

Briefings are meant to be short and accessible knowledge outputs that condense science in key messages and are used by a specifc target audience. An example of this is a policy brief which summarises key messges relevant for policy makers. 

## General Points

* In CCG we aim at publishing one briefing for every scientific paper and making it available before the scientific paper is published on our website.
* Briefing are to be published by the authors (upon final approval) on ResearchSquare (or another pre-print server with at least equivalent features e.g., assigned DOI). 
* The link to the briefing should be shared, via email, with the CCG comms officer or another point of contact e.g., for publishing on the website. "Comment_can we embed an email to the comms officer?"
* Briefings shall be published under open access licenses (e.g. CC BY 4.0). For how to choose a license, see [licenses]
* All briefings will undergo a peer-review process before publication. To access this service please submit your briefing using the following [form]. "Comment_can we embed a google form link here?"
* The structure and review workflow outlined below will apply. 

## Guidelines on structure and quality

* The briefing shall be written using the template available here [template to word or Overleaf].
* The briefing shall be 1000-1300 words in total (excluding references and acknowledgements), with an additional key message box, containing 3-4 key messages (75-150 words in total).
* The language to be used is British English (with Oxford spelling). Authors are responsible for thorough spelling and grammar checks.
* References in text are given in square brackets [1], (e.g. like in the ‘Nature’ referencing style) then provided in full in a reference list.
* The content, in general, is structured as follows:
    1. Introduction/Context: a brief description of the wider context, the need for the research being presented, and what precisely the briefing will cover.
    2. Methodology: a description of the methodology of the research, such as what models and scenarios were used and the assumptions behind; the number and type of interviews conducted and the type of interviewee; a description of the desktop study and the process of literature review.
    3. Results: a summary of what the results of the research are.
    4. Discussion/Conclusion: What the significance of the results is.
    5. Recommendations. 2-4 recommendations (e.g., policy recommendations for a policy brief). This section should be understood in isolation if at all possible. A couple of sentences briefly reiterating the context of the briefing is needed, followed by recommendations which should be clearly related to and supported by the results of the study.
    6. References. See [here] for guidlines on the referencing style. "Comment_we should link to some website for guidance on this"
    7. Acknowledgements. CCG funding (full or partial) must be captured in this section, the guidelines are found [here]. 

## Audience

The briefing should be written in language that is accessible to an audience of informed professionals. In the case of a policy brief, this may including national government officials; climate negotiators; and people that work on climate policy in international organizations, the private sector, NGOs, and other stakeholders.

## Review workflow

0. The review process shall be handled through (?)
1. Calls for briefings with different themes will be launched periodically within CCG
2. The authors write a briefing for a particular call, following all the above guidelines, and submit it with the Tag of the call and the naming convention indicated on the submission portal
3. The briefings lands on the desk of the Chief Editor, who checks that:
    * The theme is in line with the one of the call
    * All the guidelines for authors are formally respected
4. The briefings lands then on the desk of the Topic Editor(s), who check(s) that the topic is relevant, novel, conclusive.
5. The briefings is sent to at least 1 reviewer (best practice 2), who has 15 days to carry out the review.
6. The authors receive the review(s) and have 15 days to deliver the revised briefing.
7. The reviewer(s) check the revisions and, if needed, 6 & 7 are repeated.
8. The Topic Editor(s) accept the final version of the briefing.
9. The brief goes to proof-reading and the authors are potentially asked to approve the last minor (language) edits to the manuscript in a very short time (within 48 hours).
10. The briefings is published on the pre-print platform
11. The link is shared with CCG for publication on the website and other comms.
