More and more often, contemporary research is conducted by a number of young and senior researchers actively collaborating and contributing to a common project, answering an increasingly multidisplinary range of questions. 

To ensure all the people involved in the research process are rightfully acknolwegded, the [Contributor Roles Taxonomy, known as CRediT author statement][1], has been created to be used as reference to correctly capture all contributors roles and efforts dedicated in obtaining a final research output.
According to the [CRediT author statement][1], each contributors can be acknowledged via a series of pre-defined roles.

For each contributors, the following basic personal information should be provided:
- Name and Surname
- Affiliation
- [ORCiD](<https://orcid.org/>) code
- CRediT role (contribution provided to the research).
