Licensing is an important part of any output release. Once a new piece of work is ready to be made available to the wider audience, adding a license to it constitutes a good practice that helps clarifying what are the rights and duties that regulate the use of such work by other parties. 

Within the context of open science, the aim is to allow broad access and reuse of the research outputs produced. Thus, licensing should contribute to ensuring as much openness, transparency and accessibility as possible.

Each license differs in the conditions it sets on the possibility of using the licensed work for new projects and research. These conditions can include, for instance: how to correctly attribute the original authors of the work, if the work can be modified and re-used for a new (derived) work, how the derived work should be licensed, etc.

There exist mainly two different classes of licenses, each of them applicable to a specifici type of work: [open-scource licenses](#open-source-licenses) usually applie to tools or software codes, while [open access licenses](#open-access-licenses) apply to data, images and more generically knowledge content.


## Open-source Licenses
Open-source licenses are commonly characterised by allowing software ["to be freely used, modified, and shared”][1]. There exsist [three main categories of open-source licenses][2]:

1. ***Free-for-all licenses (permissive)***
This type of licenses require to acknowledge the original author(s) of the licensed work in any derivative work. However, it allows derivative works to be then published under a different type of license, and/or made proprietary.

2. ***Keep-open licenses***
This type of licenses require for the derivative work to be also released under open license. However, the derivative work (e.g. a software product) could then be included as one part of a larger proprietary work.

3. ***Share-alike (copyleft) licenses***
This type of licenses require that, if the licensed work is included in larger work or project, the entire work should be released open-source.


A few web platforms exist that provide detailed lists of open-source licenses available and related characteristics. Also, simple online tools have been created to guide you in selecting the most approrpiate open-source license based on specific needs:
- The Openmod Initiative [*Choosing a license*][3] page provides a complete overview of what should be considered when choosing an open-source license and what are the main options available
- The [*Open Source Initiative*][1] also provides a comprehensive overview of open-source licenses and standards available, with a selection of the most popular ones.
- GitHub, via [*Choosealicense.com*][4], finally provides a simple tool that, by asking few questions on the intended aim and scope of the work, suggests the most appropriate open-source license to be used.


## Open access licenses
Open access licenses are targeted towards a wide variety of knowledge formats, covering data, scientific publications, websites, presentations, simple images, etc.
The term ‘open access’ refers particularly to freely available literature, mainly accessible online, that allow people to [“read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.”][5] The aim of the open access license is to remove all contraints over the reproduction and distribution of knwoledge outputs except for the copyright, thus ensuring the authors' right to be acknowledged and cited.

The most commonly used open access licenses are all provided by the [Creative Commons](<https://creativecommons.org/>) organization, and vary in the degree of openness they guarantee.

### Creative Commons (CC) licenses
Creative Commons (CC) licenses coonsist of six different licenses that define more or less permissive rules for the reproduction and distribution of the licensed output. A complete list of the CC licenses available and their related characteristics is available on the [Creative Commons website][6]

The [Creative Commons License Chooser][7] then, provides a simple tool to guide you in selecting the most appropriate CC license for your knwoledge output, based on the most relevant feature of your choice.
