## Workflow

A computational workflow is where several processes are coordianted to handel dependencies between different computational steps.
Workflows help with executing, reusing and reproducing, as well as reporting all steps needed to characterise the processing of data, thus supporting the use of data in the research context. 
  
### Workflow stages

A plan should be establish in the form of a live document, to identify types of data and related formats that are expected to be used in the project.
