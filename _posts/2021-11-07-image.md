## Including an image in a lecture

### General indications

* Use only images which you are the copyright owner of, or which have an open access license
* You may find large open access image databases for instance on [Creative-Commons] and [Unsplash]
* Always attribute every image and report the licensing information
* Do not use images for which you do not know who the copyright owner is and what license they are available under

### Using an image

1. With an image, you must always report its metadata (source, author, license, link to the original). 
    * If you are using it on a presentation, you may add the information directly on the slide. 
    * If you are storing it, make sure you store the metadata in a relevant file and directory. More information about this on {% post_url 2021-11-17-lecture-structure %}
