## Preparing the structure of a lecture

1. Use the CCG template
2. In the title slide, include starting from the bottom: title of the lecture (in black capital letters), lecture number (in white capital letters), name of the course (in smaller black characters at the top)
3. In the second slide, introduce 4 Intended Learning Outcomes, one for each mini-lecture
4. Divide your lecture material in 4 mini-lectures with: 5 slides of content and one slide of references each (the latter only if there are any relevant references)
5. In each slide, add between 150 and 300 words of speaker notes, in plain, understandable English and avoiding acronyms (mind that the text will be read by a text-to-speach app)
6. For adding images, follow these [guidelines]({% post_url 2021-11-07-image %})

## Workflow for the review and publication of the lecture

1. Once you have completed your lecture, deliver it for review of language and content
2. Once you have implemented the feedback from point 1, deliver the lecture for addition of the audio in each slide
3. Once the audio is added, deliver the lecture to the course manager of your track for upload to OpenLearn
