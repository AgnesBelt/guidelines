## Preparing the structure of a lecture

1. Use the CCG template
2. In the title slide, include starting from the bottom: title of the lecture (in black capital letters), lecture number (in white capital letters), name of the course (in smaller black characters at the top)  
3. In the second slide, introduce 4 Intended Learning Outcomes, one for each mini-lecture
4. Divide your lecture material in 4 mini-lectures with 5 slides of content each, plus one slide of references (if any)
5. In each slide, add between 150 and 300 words of speaker notes, in plain, understandable English and avoiding acronyms (mind that the text will be read by a text-to-speach app)
